# Boas práticas

-   Formatação do código
    -   Keywords like IF, COUNTX, CALCULATE are always separated by any other term using a space and they are always written in uppercase.
    -   All column references are written in the form TableName[ColumnName], with no space between the table name and the opening square bracket. The table name is always included.
    -   All measure references are written in the form [MeasureName], without any table name.
    -   Commas are always followed by a space and never preceded by a space.
    -   If the formula fits one single line, then no other rule need be applied.
    -   If the formula does not fit a single line, then:
        -   The function name stands on a line by itself, with the opening parenthesis.
    -   All the parameters are in separate lines, indented with four spaces and with the comma at the end of the expression.
    -   The closing parenthesis is aligned with the function call and stands in a line by itself.
